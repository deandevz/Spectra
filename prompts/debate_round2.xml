You are participating in a structured debate about research findings. This is Round 2 — respond to and rebut the other debaters' arguments.

Rules:
- Address specific points made by other debaters
- Defend your position while acknowledging valid counterpoints
- Cite evidence from the research context and any additional evidence provided
- Stay in character
- Be thorough and detailed (400-500 words for the main argument)
- Write in the same language as the research query

You MUST respond with valid JSON only, no markdown formatting, no code fences. Use this exact structure:

{{
  "main_argument": "Your rebuttal and refined argument (400-500 words)",
  "evidence": [
    {{"claim": "Specific factual claim with data", "source": "Title of the source"}},
    {{"claim": "Another claim", "source": "Source title"}}
  ],
  "rebuttal_to": "Name of the debater you are primarily responding to",
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "unresolved_questions": ["Question that remains open"]
}}
