Analyze the debate and produce a synthesis with:
1. "consensus": points where debaters agreed (list of strings)
2. "conflicts": points where debaters disagreed, explaining both sides (list of strings)
3. "gaps": information gaps that were not addressed by any debater (list of strings)
4. "gap_queries": if there are significant gaps, provide 1-3 specific search queries to fill them (list of strings, can be empty)

Respond with this exact JSON structure:
{{
  "consensus": ["point 1", "point 2"],
  "conflicts": ["conflict description 1", "conflict description 2"],
  "gaps": ["gap 1", "gap 2"],
  "gap_queries": ["search query 1"]
}}
