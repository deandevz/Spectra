Research query: "{query}"

Report to evaluate:
{report}

Evaluate this research report on the following dimensions, scoring each from 0 to 10:

1. "coverage": Were all aspects of the debate and research represented in the report? Does it cover the topic comprehensively?
2. "balance": Were all perspectives treated fairly and given adequate space? Is the report balanced?
3. "citations": Were sources cited adequately throughout the text using inline citations? Are claims backed by evidence?
4. "depth": Is the analysis deep and substantive, or superficial? Does it include concrete data, statistics, names, and dates?

For each dimension, provide a brief justification.

If any dimension scores below 7, provide specific feedback on how to improve.

Respond with this exact JSON structure:
