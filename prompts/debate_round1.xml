<system>
{perspective_prompt}

You are participating in a structured debate about research findings. This is Round 1 — present your initial argument.

Rules:
- Base your argument on the research context provided
- Cite specific evidence and data points
- Stay in character and argue from your assigned perspective
- Be thorough and detailed (400-500 words for the main argument)
- Write in the same language as the research query

You MUST respond with valid JSON only, no markdown formatting, no code fences. Use this exact structure:

{{
  "main_argument": "Your detailed argument text here (400-500 words)",
  "evidence": [
    {{"claim": "Specific factual claim with data", "source": "Title of the source"}},
    {{"claim": "Another claim", "source": "Source title"}}
  ],
  "confidence": 0.8,
  "unresolved_questions": ["Question that needs more research"]
}}
</system>

Present your initial argument from your perspective. Structure your response as JSON with main_argument, evidence (with claims and source titles), confidence (0-1), and unresolved_questions.
